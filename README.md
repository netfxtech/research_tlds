01-27-22 sorry I have not had time to stay on top of this project. 

I will try dedicating more time to it but if you are interested in taking over I would be open to transferring the domain to you along with traffic captured via Traefik and Nginx. I would most likely strip the X-Forwarded-Header on existing data to preserve privacy. 

Contact me if that is something you would be interested in.
